# testequity107
Python class to control TestEquity 107 Benchtop Temperature Chamber (Environmental Chamber) using minimalmodbus and a usb-to-serial cable.

"check_serial_ports.py" should work on both Windows and Linux. This can be used to determine which serial port the temperature chamber is connected to.
This script came from the pySerial documentation.
